Hey, this repository is for enthusiasts of device modding, custom devices you made yourself, etc. Enjoy posting your creations here!
P.s., if any of you know any type of android related tech for making life with type one diabetes easier, please tell me.
My sister has it, and it's a part of her DNA, not due to obesity or age. Please help, we're already using Nightscout, it makes
it a little easier but the disease is still a pain in the ass. Please enlighten me on any new technologies that would make it easier on out family.
